**🌸 Iris Flower Classification**

🔍 Overview

This project is part of my CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. It focuses on classifying iris flower species using various features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The model is trained using a supervised machine learning algorithm on the popular Iris dataset.

📁 Dataset
Source: UCI ML Repository / Scikit-learn built-in dataset

Features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Target:

Species: setosa, versicolor, virginica

📌 Objectives
Load and explore the dataset

Visualize the relationships between features

Preprocess the data

Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.)

Evaluate model accuracy

Predict species based on user input

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Visualizations
Pairplot to explore feature distribution by species

Heatmap to check correlations between variables

✅ Model Training
Splitting data into train/test sets

Training a Logistic Regression model

Accuracy achieved: ~96–98% (depending on random split)

📉 Key Insights
Petal length and width are the most significant features for classification.

The dataset is well-separated and ideal for model evaluation.

The model performs accurately with minimal preprocessing.
